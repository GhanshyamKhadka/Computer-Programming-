'''Write a program that takes the name of a file as a command-line argument, and
 creates a backup copy of that file. The backup should contain an exact copy of the
 contents of the original and should, obviously, have a different name.
 Hint: By now, you should be getting the idea that there is a built-in way to do the
 heavy li ing here! Take a look at the "Brief Tour of the Standard Library" in the docs.'''
